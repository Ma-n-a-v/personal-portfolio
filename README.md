# personal-portfolio
This is a dynamic 3D portfolio built using ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in creating visually stunning and interactive web experiences using modern web technologies.

Features:
- 3D Graphics with ThreeJS: Render and animate 3D models, geometries, and scenes with various lighting setups.
- React Integration: Utilized React Three Fiber to seamlessly integrate 3D content into a React-based architecture.
- Responsive Design: Styled with TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive user interface across all devices.
- Smooth Animations: Enhanced interactivity and animations with Framer Motion.
- Contact Form: Implemented a functional email form using EmailJS, allowing users to get in touch directly via the portfolio.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
